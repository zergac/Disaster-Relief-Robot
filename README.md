# Disaster-Relief-Robot

INTRODUCTION

Real-time search-and-rescue robots are increasingly used to supplement the efforts of the first responders in areas affected by natural disasters. They are used to spot-check the situational awareness of people in distress, survey the extent of flood or tornado damage and the number of people that had not been evacuated from their neighborhoods, and clean debris and create passable routes.

SCENARIO

For this task, your first step will be to familiarize yourself with the Coppelia Robotics BubbleRob virtual robot and its environment. To do this, please review the information at the “BubbleRob Tutorial,” “Coppelia Robotics Resources Page,” and “Coppelia Robotics V REP Environment” web links below. The BubbleRob is a very basic robot that can be used in disaster recovery.For the next step in this task, you will thoroughly describe a disaster situation similar to the ones mentioned in the introduction. Next, you will create a virtual prototype of an autonomous robotic recovery system that demonstrates goal-seeking behaviors in navigating through a predefined area. The robotic recovery system will solve a disaster recovery problem of your choice by using the Coppelia Robotics BubbleRob and its environment, modified with at least two new obstacles, as the starting point of your prototyping. You will also add one or more sensors of your choice to the robot: these sensors will collect vital information to aid in the disaster recovery effort for the scenario you described.
